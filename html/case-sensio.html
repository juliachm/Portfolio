            In a world facing complex challenges, the power of design to drive transformative and sustainable change has never been more vital. In my recent interaction design project at the university, as part of the Transformative Design course, I and two other students collaborated with
            Sensio, a leader of welfare technology in Norway. The project called 'Design for Dignity' brings together the transformative design and visionary commitment of Sensio, united by a shared mission: to inspire change in the pursuit of sustainability.
        </p>
        <h3>Design process</h3>
        <p>The interdisciplinary nature of the project required exploring different perspectives, so that we could visualize the desirable future. We wanted a better understanding of many different aspects of sustainability and democracy within elderly care, and how transformative design could address the various challenges. In the start-up phase of the project, we wanted to identify how the United Nations's sustainability goals fit into sustainable development in elderly care. Information from various sources helped us to gain better insight and theoretical clarification of the elderly care-wicked problem. Data collection in different phases of the project work helped us to design and adjust our vision in line with sustainability opportunities in Norway. Our focus has been on several converging parts through three iterations. Each iteration was centered around creating value for the project and making reliable improvements.
        </p>
        <p class="methods">Methods crucial for the project:</p>
        <ul class="case-ul">
            <li>Annotations</li>
            <li>Gigamap</li>
            <li>Workshop</li>
            <li>Social Network Map</li>
            <li>Social Design Pathways</li>
            <li>Scenarios</li>
            <li>Future Wheel Model</li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            Several interviews and workshops with various stakeholders
            (Sensio, the elderly, relatives, volunteers, the municipality, senior centers) helped us to understand the complexity of this wicked problem. Based on the data analysis, we developed a prototype of an app that combines aspects of two
            Sensio apps and includes collaboration with volunteers. Sensio allowed us to use their Figma library, so the final prototype maintains design consistency, including design assets such as buttons, typography style and other UI components. This makes the prototype easy to update and maintain as the project might evolve in the future.

        </div>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Taking wicked problems as a starting point was an unusual but exciting angle. This topic was also my first encounter with many of the models and theories that were introduced. Some of the methods were used for own exploration of the topic, but also as models for communicating impressions and ideas. When working with healthcare services and vulnerable user groups, there are always challenges and ethical issues involved. Several such issues became clear to us via the dialogue with the Volunteer Center. Another problem area in healthcare services in general is privacy. </p>
        <p>For older users to be comfortable using the system, the prototype needed to make it easy for them to choose the service without feeling ashamed of asking for help, or nervousness in connection with testing out a system that involves effort from other known or unknown people.</p>
        <p>With an increasingly aging population in Norway and a greater need to ensure that the elderly have as dignified and independent a life as possible, this solution can reduce the burden on healthcare personnel and relatives by strengthening relationships between voluntary organisations, the elderly and their networks, providing more autonomy to, and increase socialization among the elderly and help ensure that the needs of the elderly living at home are met more adequately in everyday life.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I believe that this solution can help to create increased attention to the elderly care situation, and is a small step forward towards a fairer and more democratic society.
        The project was delivered to Sensio, who can further use it for the development of their solutions.
